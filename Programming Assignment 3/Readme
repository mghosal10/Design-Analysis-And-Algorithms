Binary Search

Given a sorted list of distinct integers A [1], A[2],...,A[n], you want to find out whether there is an index i for which A[i]=i. Give an algorithm that runs in time O (log n). 
For example, A = [-2 -1 1 3 5 6 7] does have such an index, i.e., A [3] = 3. But A= [0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7] doesnâ€™t have such an index.
